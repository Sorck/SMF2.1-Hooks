	Example usage:
	```php
	function my_admin_search(&$language_files, &$include_files, &$settings_search)
	{
		// We have our search language strings in myLang language file
		$language_files[] = 'myLang';
		// Include the file that contains the search settings info for our
		// section.
		$include_files[] = 'mySourceFile';
		// Add our search from the following function
		$settings_search[] = array('MyModSettings', 'area=modifications;sa=myMod');
	}
	// And in mySourceFile.php
	function MyModSettings($return_config = false)
	{
		/**
		 * Defines a simple mod page - i.e. one which includes a permission
		 * selection for the manage_my_mod permission, a title of Settings,
		 * localised using language files, and a checkbox that toggles the
		 * $modSettings['enable_mod'] setting.
		 */
		$config_vars = array(
			array('title', 'settings')
			array('permissions', 'manage_my_mod'),
			'',
			array('check', 'enable_mod')
		);
		
		if ($return_config)
			/**
			 * NB: This doesn't actually include the logic to output this to
			 * the user but it does define the logic sufficiently to help the
			 * search utility search within our page.
			 * See ManageSmileys.php lines 152 to 182 (in SMF 2.1 beta 1) for
			 * code to output the form.
			 */
			return $config_vars;
	}

	This allows you to find myMod pages within the admin search section. It
	searches over text in your pages so, if you have a button which mentions
	smileys in it's help text, it will appear in the search pages.
