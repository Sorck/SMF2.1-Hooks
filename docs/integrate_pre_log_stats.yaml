title: integrate_pre_log_stats
params:
	- &$no_stat_actions
docs: |
	Example usage:
	```php
	function my_pre_log_stats(&$no_stat_actions)
	{
		// Don't record users as being online if they are on the admin pages
		// (i.e. those with ?action=admin in them)
		$no_stat_actions[] = 'admin';
	}```
	The result is that, when you navigate to ./index.php?action=admin, you will
	no longer be recorded in the who's online log.
	
	This feature is internally used for downloading attachments, handling
	likes, performing AJAX requests for search suggestions and the likes. I.e.
	use it when it makes no sense to tell others that that's what the user is
	doing.
