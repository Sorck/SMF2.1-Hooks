title: integrate_simple_actions
params:
	- &$simpleActions
	- &$simpleAreas
	- &$simpleSubActions
docs: |
	Example usage:
	```php
	function my_simple_actions(&$simpleActions, &$simpleAreas, $simpleSubActions)
	{
		// Applies to /index.php?action=my_simple_action
		$simpleActions[] = 'my_simple_action';
		
		// Applies to /index.php?area=my_simple_area
		$simpleAreas[] = 'my_simple_area';
		
		// Applies to /index.php?sa=my_simple_sub_action
		$simpleSubActions[] = 'my_simple_sub_action';
	}```
	If any of the URL schemes above apply then the index template will not be
	loaded. This is used in findmember, fast quote, admin help etc.
	
	You should avoid generic areas and subactions for this purpose as they may
	break other mods using similar names (they will no longer load templates as
	expected).
	
	NB: If you want to output XML then you may be better off appending ?XML as
	this loads the XML templates.
	
	NB: Currently ?area=popup and any other simple actions that don't actually
	exist (e.g. you intended to use ?action=myAction;area=simpleArea but call
	just ?area=simpleArea) then the board index loads without full templates)
