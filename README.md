# SMF2.1-Hooks
This is destined to be a full list of all hooks in SMF 2.1, along with information about how they work.

Currently we have a list of almost all of the SMF 2.1 hooks. We will later be expanding to include the remaining hooks.

# TODO
* Some hooks need to be moved from 'unparsed' in hooks.json and properly discussed.
* Some hooks seem to be dynamically generated (such as integrate_admin_include) so they will need to be manually added.
